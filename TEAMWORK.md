#### Communication:
Communication occurred both synchronously and asynchronously. Majority of asynchronous communication was held via a group chat on the STAT 545 Slack channel about initiating our first synchronous meeting via zoom. Asynchronous communication in the slack group chat also contained minor questions about the project in general. Any specific questions that we had about the project were asked in GitHub Issues, and were answered in our synchronous zoom meetings. We met synchronously on zoom on three separate occasions, which are detailed below. Synchronous communication was found to be far superior to asynchronous, as all team members could work together through the questions we had and help each other in real time. We were also able to give examples and visuals using the share screen function on zoom. The majority of synchronous zoom meetings lasted about 1 hour.


#### Meetings:
The first zoom meeting was on Wednesday September 20 2023 from 10am - 11am, and was scheduled using the Slack group chat.
**Things that occurred:**
We discussed the division of labour and possible times of second and third meetings. Li Ju created the main GitHub repository on September 18 2023 and invited us as collaborators during the meeting. Each team member created their own branch in the main GitHub repository during the meeting. We then discussed and assigned who will review each others pull request, and simply went clockwise around the zoom as the names appeared on the monitor.

The second zoom meeting was on Wednesday September 20 2023 from 9pm - 11pm, and was scheduled using the Slack group chat.
**Things that occurred:**
We discussed some issues we ran into while starting the group project and resolved them together. We then planned our timeline on when we wanted everyone's projects to be finished by. Everyone agreed that they would finish their portion of the project by 11:59pm on Thursday September 21 2023 so we had some time to review before the deadline of 5pm on Friday September 22 2023.

The third zoom meeting was on Thursday September 21 2023 from 9pm - 10pm, and was scheduled using the Slack group chat.
**Things that occurred:**
We discussed all the questions that were asked in GitHub Issues and worked through them together. We then confirmed that everyone would finish by the agreed upon timeline that was discussed in the second zoom meeting. We then finished all pull requests, completed any last-minute editing, and merged the branches to the main branch. 

 
#### Division of Labour:

Name | Labour
---- | -----
Alex | Will work on the README.md file for the project in conjunction with Hitasha (drafted the response that is written in the README document with Hitsha, pushed the README file with text to GitHub), and will review Li’s work
Hitasha | Will work on the README.md file for the project in conjunction with Alex (drafted the response that is written in the README document with Alex, resolved merge conflict, reviewed Alex’s work and added markdown features to format the README document text), and will review Alex’s work
Bradley | Will work on the teamwork.md file for the project, and will review Hitasha’s work
Li | Created the collaborative repository and added the other team members as collaborators, will work on the troubleshooting for the file, and will review Bradley’s work


#### Timing:
During the second zoom meeting, we all agreed to finish our respective portions of the project by 11:59pm on Thursday, September 21 2023. That way, we would all have time to review each others work and make any necessary edits and comments before the deadline of the project. During our third zoom meeting, we again confirmed that everyone was able to complete their work at the agreed upon deadline.
